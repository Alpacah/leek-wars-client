## Deployment
Prerequisites: **Python 3**

The project is very easy to install and deploy in 10s:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/leek-wars/leek-wars-client.git
cd leek-wars-client
npm i
make # or python3 leekwars.py
```
Then go to `localhost:8012` in your browser (you can change the port in the python script).

*Be careful*, this project is only the front end of Leek Wars, so it's connected to the
production server. When you log into this local version, you will use your real account!
